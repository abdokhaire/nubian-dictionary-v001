# nubian-dictionary-v001
This is version 001 of The Nubian Dictionary is an interactive digitized version of the actual dictionary which was lexicographed by Mr. Youssef Sumbagh.
We stand on the shoulders of those before us, without the work of Mr. Sumbagh we would not have been able to put this together.

HOW TO USE IT.
Once you’ve cloned or download the files, please make sure that “The Nubian Dictionary” executable is in the same folder as the text files, then you simply double click the executable (please give it a few minutes to start).
That’s it.
Once the program starts you will have some options, including a “word search” option, in which you type in a word in English and it will tell you what it is in Nubian.


WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS REPO.
An executable, a Python file and Three (3) text files. 

The Executable: “The Nubian Dictionary”.
This is the program, you simply double click the executable (give it a minute to load) and once that happens you are able to use the interactive dictionary to find out how to say words in the Nubian language.

The Python File: “nd_final”.
This is the full code of the program, this is our first major python project, so I apologize in advance if the code is not up to standards. If you wish, you can run this code in your favorite IDE, but it is literally what was compiled to become the executable.

The Three (3) Text Files: “nd-days” , “nd-numbers”, “nd-wordsearch”.
These are the files that program calls on to provide you with the information you requested from it.
Yes you can simply open the text files and see the information, that is easy in the case of “days” and “numbers”, because they are small.
The “nd-wordsearch” is basically a text version of the dictionary, and was the main purpose of the program.


MORE VERSIONS TO COME?
I hope so. The goal of creating and releasing this version of The Nubian Dictionary is that it would become a catalyst of greater things in the future. The program is far from perfect, but it is functional. I’m hoping that as we grow as programmers, we would be able to incorporate that into better versions. We still have not found a way (yet) to read in the Arabic (Unicode) parts of the scanned pages that we have found of the dictionary. We are also hoping that in the future we might be able to create a GUI of some kind so that is more than just white text on black screen.

Andaandi Nubian (Dongolawi)

-   [Anter Alsharif's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGfXpED6Rurj_Rw1vFD7WA) (ARB, VID)

-   There aren't too many videos on here, but the ones that are there are helpful!

-   [A Reference Grammar of Kunuz Nubian by Ahmed S. Abdel-Hafiz](https://www.sfu.ca/~gerdts/teaching/Abdel-HafizNubian.pdf) (ENG, GRAM)

-   While Kunuz (Mattokki) Nubian is spoken in Egypt, it is largely mutually intelligible with Andaandi, so this should still be a helpful resource.

-   [Dongolese Nubian: A Grammar by Carl Hubert Armbruster](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/1c011a76-d4dd-4bfc-97e1-2c776306a736) (ENG, GRAM)
-   [Dongolese Nubian: A Lexicon by Carl Hubert Armbruster](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/cf3b758f-e1de-4bce-9487-fc1e122c37a2) (ENG, DICT IL->ENG)
-   [An English-Nubian Comparative Dictionary by GW Murray](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/2afff4d5-35a3-450a-84fd-ed8af8c7d25f) (ENG, DICT IL->ENG)

-   This dictionary is crazy comprehensive and features vocabulary for Andaandi (Dongolawi), Nobiin (Mahasi), Midob (Darfur Nubian), and Kenzi (Mattokki Nubian), I just wish it was organized the other way! It not only includes nouns, but particles with examples. Very useful.

-   [Mosab Omer Osman's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/mosabomer/videos) (ARB, VID)

-   This is a tutorial for Mattokki Nubian spoken by Kenuzi Nubians in Egypt, but Mattokki and Andaandi are largely mutually intelligible (many would argue they're the same language), so this remains useful.

-   [The Nubian Dictionary (English - Arabic - Nubian) by Yousif Sambaj](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/3361af1a-6b88-4f3f-a894-189cee31aa7f) (DICT ENG/ARB->IL)

-   This dictionary is awesome because it has English, Arabic, and both Kenzi-Dongolawi and Nobiin, along with grammar explanations in the back. It is also organized by the English word, which is very rare regarding the dictionaries I've found which is a plus. That said, the transcription here is an absolute nightmare, particularly in English. Rather than use any consistent spelling rules, Sambaj seems to be writing words in a way that he thinks would make it easiest for an American English speaker to read, and it takes a long time to kind of figure out the pecularities, and even then it's a mess. Sambaj's Arabic is also significantly better than his English. The preface of the book is also incredibly silly, as Sambaj presents some absolutely nutty theories of the origins of Nubians, including the possibility that they came from India.
-   There is a digital version of the dictionary that you can [find here.](https://github.com/bini-tek/nubian-dictionary-v001) It's only compatible with Windows and takes some technical know-how to set up, but some may find it easier to search for the words they need by typing them rather than scrolling through a PDF of Sambaj's dictionary.

-   [Nubi App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nobi.nobi&hl=en_US&gl=US) (ENG/ARB, OTH)

-   This app is really good for being able to get a grasp on pronounciation, but it's limited: the progression is kind of all over the place, there are no vocab lists or detailed explanations of grammar, it's great that the Nubian alphabet is used but it's very inconsistent. Overall I wouldn't say it's useless but I really do hope the app gets improved in the future. I'd say use this alongside other resources.

-   [Nubian Language Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/nubian.language/) (ENG/ARB, OTH)

-   This page includes song translations and vocabulary lists, but the best thing is that the vocab is generally accompanied by audio which is great for learning pronounciation. My biggest issue is the reliance on Arabic transcription; thankfully there's the audio, but otherwise Arabic letters just don't work for Nubian.

Beria (Zaghawa)

-   [Beria by Alsadik Sidik and Bormay Nill](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/451ceaf4-8249-44f3-b884-6cb70207755c) (BER, OTH)
-   [Beria Dictionary by Roger Blench](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/27bf9195-67ca-4b2c-9d69-a7df342418b0) (ENG, DICT IL->ENG)
-   [The Beria Keyboard Project](https://www.facebook.com/BeriaInYourHands/) (ARB, VID)

-   The videos here primarily focus on Beria language literacy.

-   [The Simplest Way for Learning the Zaghawa Language by Nasradin Mohammed Adam](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/6f1ae835-4e54-432c-bdf8-07f7b73b272a) (ENG/ARB, TXT)

Bertha (Funj)

-   [Bertha - English - Amharic - Arabic Dictionary by Susanne Neudorf and others](https://ur.b-ok.lat/book/5862128/d68ce3) (ENG, DICT IL->ENG/ARB/AMH)

-   A dictionary for the Mayu dialect of the Berta language. I haven't gone through it myself but the person who recommended it to me criticizes the overrepresentation of Arabic loanwords.

-   [Fundamental Dialogues in Berta/Funj by Nakao Shuichiro](http://jael.info/SEL/pub/2019/Nakao-2019.pdf) (ENG, TXT/GRAM)

-   The goal of this study is to present basic information about the language's grammar and phonology in textbook form, but, from what I've read of it, it requires a degree of linguistic knowledge (i.e. knowledge of various grammatical and phonological terms, IPA literacy).

Bidawiyet (Beja, i.e. Hadandawa and Bishariin)

-   [Beja Pedagogical Grammar by Klaus and Charlotte Wedekind and Abuzeinab Musa](https://www.afrikanistik-aegyptologie-online.de/archiv/2008/1283/beja_pedagogical_grammar_final_links_numbered.pdf) (ENG, TXT/GRAM)

-   This book is apparently written and structured with language learners in mind, but, from my quick assessment, leans heavily on a lot of linguistic vocabulary, so a degree of linguistic know-how is helpful in ways it may not be for other books. It is also supposed to be accompanied by audio data, but I haven't located it.

Fòòraŋ Bèlè (Fur)

-   [Omad Korom's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrVeML9l0hrHEeamqp2KViw/videos) (ARB/FUR, VID)

-   So Omad is...prolific and doesn't have a lot of playlists so a lot of his Fur learning videos are buried under other videos about the revolution or Sudanese politics in general, but there's also music on here and vocabulary lessons in Arabic, as well as a series on Fur names (which actually does have a playlist).

-   [Omer Soba's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/omersoba/videos) (ARB, VID)

-   There's no great playlist of all the Fur resources here, either, but they are less buried than they are with Omad's.

-   [Dǐjakajag Kʉmʉ̂ndʉ Da̠rdɨ's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DijakajakKumundu/videos) (ENG/ARB/FUR, VID)

-   The channel actually features a mixture of languages: there's some English in there, some Arabic, but primarily it seems like a lot of the videos are totally in Fur, so it may not be useful until you have a basis in the language.

Masarak (Masalit)

-   [Kana masaraka gâr meni!](https://kanamasaraka.wordpress.com/) (ENG/ARB/FREN, OTH)

-   This website isn't a single resource, but rather a portal to a variety of resources, including books and videos in multiple languages.
-   [Here's an updated version of the site,](https://masarak.org/en/home) I'm not sure if it makes the other obsolete or not so I'll leave both links, but here ya go!

-   [A Masalit Grammar with Notes on Other Languages of Darfur and Wadai by John Edgar](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/John%20Edgar/A%20Masalit%20Grammar_%20With%20Notes%20on%20Other%20Languages%20of%20Darfur%20and%20Wadai%20(272)/A%20Masalit%20Grammar_%20With%20Notes%20on%20Other%20Lan%20-%20John%20Edgar.pdf) (ENG, GRAM)

Nobiin Nubian (Halfawi/Mahasi/Fadijja)

-   PAID: [Basic Nubian Language and Grammar by Taharqa Sa Amun](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Nubian-Language-Grammar-Taharqa/dp/1628471077) (ENG, TXT)

-   This is the only paid resource I'll mention since I've bought it, I'll say this: the formatting is terrible on Kindle (the text renders very small so it's near impossible to read), but this is otherwise an easy to understand and quality textbook, despite its god-awful cover. It has more grammar explanations than other resources I've found, which is very useful.

-   [An English-Nubian Comparative Dictionary by GW Murray](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/2afff4d5-35a3-450a-84fd-ed8af8c7d25f) (ENG, DICT IL-ENG)

-   See comments in Andaandi section.

-   [Nobîn nog gery by Muhammad Mutwalla Badr](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/54db2192-0584-42d6-8382-b3e9ca068e68) (ARB, TXT)

-   I always recommend this when people are interested in learning Nobiin, it's simply the best resource I've found for the language. It's a true textbook that is very easy to understand, and the Nubian is transcribed in a very easy to read manner, although there are a few inconsistencies.

-   [Shazley Esmail's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shazlyasmail/videos) (ARB, VID)

-   Warning to headphone users.

-   [The Nubian Dictionary (English - Arabic - Nubian) by Yousif Sambaj](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/3361af1a-6b88-4f3f-a894-189cee31aa7f) (DICT ENG/ARB->IL)

Tìdn-Àal (Midob/Darfur Nubian)

-   [Tìdn-Àal: A Study of Midob (Darfur Nubian) by Roland Werner](http://suntuwekane.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/9848c359-0e21-4387-aa6d-829f554c0a73) (ENG, GRAM)

-   This is very much a linguistics book, not so much aimed towards serious learners, but I would still say it's useful, it also includes a list of Midob personal names and place names, which I find interesting.

-   [Midob Language Blog by Manfred Gruning](http://midob-language.blogspot.com/) (ENG, OTH)

Tigre/Tigrayit (spoken by groups like the Beni Amer and Habab)

-   [Dehai Tigre Page](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasmerom/Eritrean_languages/tigre/) (ENG, TXT)

-   This now defunct website basically acts as a textbook: while there are some formatting issues, this is by far the most comprehensive free Tigre resource I've found.

-   [TigreLanguage YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdzBwHfEBlQNzDnQSqm4a4g) (ENG, VID)

-   While there are very few videos they may prove useful as an intro to the language.

-   [Vocabulary of the Tigre Language](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwidi8HN-LjtAhUyHTQIHQ6iB5kQFjASegQIChAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forgottenbooks.com%2Fde%2Fdownload%2FVocabularyoftheTigreLanguage_10443034.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2wHOzAkh1sv_QGN2_U5pn1) (ENG, OTH)

-   Sections of this book are behind a paywall (not to mention that it seems to be have written by a colonial explorer of Africa, which is not ideal), but the part of it that is accessible for free is still quite useful.
